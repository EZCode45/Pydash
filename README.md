# Pydsh
## Pygame geometry dash
### _Code by Yonah Aviv
Implementation of Geometry Dash in Python 3.9 with the interactive graphics library for python, Pygame(v2.0+).

Tap to jump over spikes, avoid crashing into walls, and interact with orbs to jump in mid-air.


Currently, there are 2 levels out of the box, both made using [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/), a 2d tile based level editor.

[Go to code](/main.py)

Make sure you are running at least Python 3.9 and Pygame 2.0 on your machine.

To install Pygame module, run the following from your command prompt/PowerShell on Windows or the equivalent program on OS X:
```
pip install pygame
```

Then in your python file:
```python
import pygame
```
if you don't recognize anything up to here, read a tutorial for [Python](https://coderslegacy.com/python/learning-the-basics/) and [Pygame](https://coderslegacy.com/python/python-pygame-tutorial/)
